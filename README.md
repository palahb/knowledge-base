# Knowledge Base

This is my personal knowledge base for coding and software development.  
I use it to collect notes, research, and snippets that I donâ€™t want to forget.  

Everything here is in markdown for simplicity and long-term readability.  
Itâ€™s not meant to be perfect or exhaustive â€” just a place where I can return later and quickly recall what Iâ€™ve learned.
